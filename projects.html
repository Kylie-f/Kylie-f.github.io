            <h3>Blog Website</h3>
            <img src="images/ch678.png" alt="Preview of Blog Website" width="600" height="400">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Blog application that allows users to read, create, edit, and delete posts. The functionality CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) is the dominant pattern for most websites, and this is implemented here with a blog app featuring a homepage listing all posts and an individual page for each post. CSS was introduced for styling. In addition, chapters 6, 7, and 8 of the Django Book were particularly useful for understanding URL routing, view logic, and templates. Chapter 6 covers URL dispatching and routing, explaining how requests are mapped to view functions. Chapter 7 explores views and their role in processing requests and returning responses. Chapter 8 provides a deep dive into templates, focusing on how to use Django's template system to display data dynamically.</p>
